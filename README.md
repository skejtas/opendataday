Visualize the link between air quality and community demographics. We dont have description, create one: [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/codeforcroatia/codeacross/issues/new)

Violence Prevention & Violence Interruption Programs

What's the link between currently operating violence prevention / violence interruption programs and crime rates in those neighborhoods? We dont have project description, create one: [Add new project](http://codeforcroatia.org/projects/create) using using [template for project plan](template-project_plan.md).

Web-based Mapping Tool Focused for Vacant real estate in your city
---------------
Start putting vacant real estate in your city to good use by making it available for renting. The first step is to map all of the vacant city real estate. [Read more](/Otvorena-imovina.md) 

Take a look at the web-based map community created at Oakland Data Day: [City Farm Share - Mapping Vacant Lot Data!](https://github.com/map-communities/old-oakland-vacant-lots)

The CodeAcross 2014 resultant project can be found [here](http://zagreb.codeforcroatia.org/otvorene-karte/imovina-zagreb-2011.html) and the source can be viewed [here](https://github.com/openzagreb/otvorene-karte/).

Zagreb Officials Data (PopIt)
---------------
Delve deep in to contact data of officials in City of Zagreb to help make more educated decisions on city's needs. [Contribute](https://zagreb.popit.mysociety.org)

Zagreb Council Transcripts (SayIt)
---------------
Publish transcripts from meetings or share statements from those in power. Anyone can use SayIt, alone or in collaboration with others. SayIt uses PopIt as a elected officials database.

**For councils and organisations that hold public meetings**
Still publishing meeting transcripts on PDFs? SayIt makes it easier for your readers to find the parts that really interest them.

Unlike crusty old PDFs, SayIt works beautifully on every device from a phone to a tablet to a desktop. And it’s acccessible for screenreaders and assistive devices. [Contribute](http://zagreb-skupstina.sayit.mysociety.org)

Zagreb Officials Contact Form (WriteIt)
---------------

As an extension of PopIt (API with officials data), you can setup own instance of WriteIt for sending emails directly to elected officials. [See Zagreb WriteIt instance here](http://grad-zagreb-hrvatska.writeit.ciudadanointeligente.org/en/)

Crime Report Data Mapped to Show Common Criminal Routes
---------------
Map crimes linked to perpetrators to determine overall crime vectors and aid police in determining hot routes. [Read more](/Otvoreni-incidenti.md)

Building Permits Database
---------------
Create open access to the database of building permits. We dont have project description, create one: [Add new project](http://codeforcroatia.org/projects/create) using [template for project plan](template-project_plan.md).

Scraping Web Sites To Deliberate More Data
---------------
Scrape content from public websites - still a critical tool for liberating public data! We dont have description, create one: [Read more](/Open-civic-data-scrapers.md)

Open Disclosure - Bringing Political Candidates Campaign Money to Light
---------------
Create a campaign finance data tool that clearly shows the flow of money into and out of campaigns. Ensure government integrity and transparency in campaign activities by opening up campaign finance data to the public. We dont have project description, create one: [Add new project](http://codeforcroatia.org/projects/create) using [template for project plan](template-project_plan.md).

[Example](https://github.com/openoakland/opendisclosure)

Food Inspection Open Data
---------------
Food safety plays a critical role in any public health program. The Local Inspector Value-entry Specification (LIVES) lets citizens better use inspection results to inform where they will eat next. [Read more](/Otvoreni-podaci-sanitarne-inspekcije.md)

The CodeAcross 2014 resultant project can be found [here](http://codeforcroatia.github.io/sanitarnipodaci/) and the source can be viewed [here](https://github.com/codeforcroatia/sanitarnipodaci).

Visualize MojZagreb - 311 requests
---------------
MojZagreb is a service that enables citizens using a simple application, review and comment irregularities and problems in Zagreb and receiving feedback from the City in terms of problem solving. We dont have project description, create one: [Add new project](http://codeforcroatia.org/projects/create) using [template for project plan](template-project_plan.md).

Bulk export data can be found [here](http://data.zagreb.hr/dataset/mojzagreb) - use that data to create visualization and statistics. Hint: try free [Infogr.am](https://infogr.am) service to create infographics.

Tourist guide
---------------
Redeploy existing code: Public Art Finder helps users find public art through a mobile, map-based UI allowing them to view additional background information on individual artworks. [Read more](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/public-art-finder/). We dont have project description, create one: [Add new project](http://codeforcroatia.org/projects/create) using [template for project plan](template-project_plan.md).

Data source: Zagreb Tourist Board has mobile portal with some sightseeing data and that data is available in XML, so check [here](http://www1.zagreb.hr/zkult/xml/object8_en.xml) - some of it is already downloaded [here](https://app.box.com/s/ogaz2awga9xptclkgb0bdxzp3koauz14).

Build with data what is available and @OpenZagreb will speak with city officials to keep permanent record on their web sites in XML form. Document if changes in XML structure are needed / recommended.

Open city maps
---------------
Use existing source code for Mobile Fusion Maps to visualize anything. [Read more](http://codeforcroatia.org/projects/otvorene_karte).
